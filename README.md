# Valora

**Valora is a public-context intelligence platform for residential locations in the Netherlands.**

It helps users understand the "vibe" and statistics of a neighborhood by aggregating data from public sources (CBS, PDOK, OpenStreetMap, Luchtmeetnet) into a unified, explainable context report.

> **Valora is NOT a scraper.** It does not copy listing photos or descriptions. It enriches location data with public context.

Welcome to the repository! Our goal is to ensure you understand exactly how Valora works within 10 minutes. This README provides a clear architecture overview, quick-start setup instructions, and an API reference to get you up to speed immediately.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions (Quick Start)

Follow these steps to get the entire system running locally. For a detailed walkthrough, see the **[Onboarding Guide](docs/onboarding.md)**.

### Prerequisites & Dependencies
Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Docker Desktop** (for spinning up the local PostgreSQL database)
- **.NET 10.0 SDK** (for building and running the backend API)
- **Flutter SDK** (for running the mobile app on an emulator/device)
- **Node.js 18+ & npm** (for the web admin dashboard)

### 1. Setup & Start Local Infrastructure
First, you need to start the underlying database. Valora uses a PostgreSQL instance orchestrated via Docker Compose.

```bash
# Start the database in the background
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```
*Troubleshooting:*
- If `docker-compose` fails, ensure Docker Desktop is running and actively connected.
- Ensure port `5432` is not already in use by a local Postgres instance (e.g., Homebrew's Postgres).

### 2. Configure & Run Backend
The backend aggregates data and serves the API.

**Note:** The `.env` file is primarily used by Docker. When running locally via `dotnet run`, configuration is read from `appsettings.Development.json` or Environment Variables.

```bash
cd backend
# Option A: Set secrets via User Secrets (Recommended)
dotnet user-secrets init --project Valora.Api
dotnet user-secrets set "JWT_SECRET" "YourStrongSecretKeyHere_MustBeAtLeast32CharsLong!" --project Valora.Api

# Option B: Set Environment Variable manually
export JWT_SECRET="YourStrongSecretKeyHere_MustBeAtLeast32CharsLong!"

# Run the API
dotnet run --project Valora.Api
```
*Verify: Open `http://localhost:5253/api/health` in your browser. You should see `{"status":"healthy", "timestamp": "..."}`.*

### 3. Configure & Run Mobile App
The Flutter app is the primary interface for users.

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: The default `.env` points to the PRODUCTION API.
> Change `API_URL` in `.env` to your local backend:
> - Android Emulator: `http://10.0.2.2:5253/api`
> - iOS Simulator / Desktop: `http://localhost:5253/api`
>
> *(Note: Use port `5001` if running backend via Docker)*

```bash
cd ../apps/flutter_app
cp .env.example .env
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### 4. Configure & Run Admin Dashboard
The web dashboard for managing users and system settings.

```bash
cd ../apps/admin_page
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Valora's architecture is specifically designed to act as an aggregation layer for public data, rather than a scraping pipeline. It is built on two primary structural pillars:

1.  **Strict Clean Architecture**: The backend strictly segregates concerns. External integrations (EF Core, HTTP clients) live in `Infrastructure`, HTTP routing lives in `Api`, and pure business logic lives in `Domain` and `Application`.
2.  **Fan-Out / Fan-In Fetching Pattern**: Instead of persisting millions of real estate listings, the system queries external providers in parallel only when a user requests a report.

### System Context & Data Flow

The following diagram shows how Valora fits into the broader ecosystem.

```mermaid
C4Container
    title System Context Diagram

    Person(user, "Mobile User", "A user looking for neighborhood insights")
    Person(admin, "Admin User", "Platform administrator")

    Container_Boundary(valora, "Valora Platform") {
        Container(app, "Flutter App", "Dart/Flutter", "Provides the mobile interface for users")
        Container(web, "Admin Dashboard", "React/Vite", "Provides management tools for admins")
        Container(api, "Valora API", ".NET 10 Minimal API", "Aggregates data and serves reports")
        ContainerDb(db, "Database", "PostgreSQL", "Stores users, logs, and cache")
    }

    System_Ext(pdok, "PDOK Locatieserver", "Geocoding and Map WMS")
    System_Ext(cbs, "CBS Open Data", "Demographics and Stats")
    System_Ext(osm, "OpenStreetMap / Overpass", "Amenities and POIs")
    System_Ext(lucht, "Luchtmeetnet", "Air Quality Data")

    Rel(user, app, "Uses")
    Rel(admin, web, "Uses")
    Rel(app, api, "HTTPS / JSON", "Requests reports")
    Rel(web, api, "HTTPS / JSON", "Manages system")
    Rel(api, db, "EF Core", "Persists data")

    Rel(api, pdok, "HTTPS", "Geocoding")
    Rel(api, cbs, "HTTPS", "Fetch Stats")
    Rel(api, osm, "HTTPS", "Fetch Amenities")
    Rel(api, lucht, "HTTPS", "Fetch Air Quality")
```

For a deeper dive into *why* we built it this way, see **[Architecture Decisions](docs/architecture-decisions.md)**.

### The "Fan-Out" Aggregation Pattern
When a user requests a context report, the system queries multiple external sources in parallel ("Fan-Out") and then aggregates the results ("Fan-In") into a unified score.

```mermaid
graph TD
    User((User)) -->|1. Request Report| API[Valora API]
    API -->|2. Orchestrate| Service[ContextReportService]

    subgraph "Fan-Out (Parallel Execution)"
        Service -->|Geocode| PDOK[PDOK Locatieserver]
        Service -->|Stats| CBS[CBS Open Data]
        Service -->|Amenities| OSM[OpenStreetMap / Overpass]
        Service -->|Air Quality| Air[Luchtmeetnet]
    end

    PDOK -->|Coords| Service
    CBS -->|Demographics| Service
    OSM -->|Shops/Parks| Service
    Air -->|PM2.5| Service

    Service -->|3. Normalize & Score| Service
    Service -->|4. Return Report| API
    API -->|5. Response| User

    API -.->|Async Cache| RAM[(In-Memory Cache)]
```

### The "Persistence" Writing Pattern
When a user writes data (like creating a new workspace), Valora enforces strict Clean Architecture layers. Here is the visual flow of a persistence request from API to Database:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as Client App (Flutter/Web)
    participant API as Valora.Api (Endpoints)
    participant App as Valora.Application (Service)
    participant Domain as Valora.Domain (Entity)
    participant Repo as Valora.Infrastructure (Repository)
    participant DB as PostgreSQL

    Client->>API: POST /api/workspaces
    API->>API: Validate Request
    API->>App: IWorkspaceService.CreateWorkspaceAsync
    App->>Domain: Create Workspace Entity
    Domain-->>App: Workspace Instance
    App->>Repo: AddAsync(Workspace) & SaveChangesAsync()
    Repo->>DB: INSERT INTO "Workspaces"
    DB-->>Repo: Acknowledge Insert
    Repo-->>App: Completed
    App-->>API: Map to WorkspaceDto
    API-->>Client: 201 Created
```

## 💡 Key Concepts

### 1. The "Fan-Out" Context Report
When a user requests a report for an address, Valora does **not** look up a pre-existing record. It generates the report in real-time by querying multiple external sources in parallel.

- **Why?** Data freshness and coverage. We don't need to scrape or store millions of records.
- **How?** See `ContextReportService.cs`. It uses `Task.WhenAll` to fetch data from CBS, PDOK, and OSM simultaneously.

### 2. Batch Job Processing (City Ingestion)
Background tasks, such as fetching all neighborhoods for a city from CBS, are handled using a robust background worker architecture. This decouples long-running tasks from API requests.

- **Why?** To prevent API request timeouts and handle massive ingestion jobs reliably in the background without blocking the UI.
- **How?** See `BatchJobExecutor.cs`. The `BatchJobWorker` continuously polls for pending jobs. Once grabbed, a `CityIngestionJobProcessor` fetches the neighborhoods from PDOK and fetches stats from CBS for each.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Admin as Admin Dashboard
    participant API as Valora.Api (AdminEndpoints)
    participant Service as BatchJobService (Application)
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant Worker as BatchJobWorker (HostedService)
    participant Processor as CityIngestionJobProcessor
    participant External as CBS / PDOK

    Admin->>API: POST /api/admin/jobs { type: "CityIngestion", target: "Amsterdam" }
    API->>Service: CreateJobAsync(...)
    Service->>DB: INSERT INTO "BatchJobs" (Status: Pending)
    Service-->>API: 201 Created (JobId)
    API-->>Admin: Job Created

    loop Every 10 Seconds
        Worker->>DB: GetNextPendingJobAsync() (Atomic Lock)
        alt No Job
            Worker->>Worker: Sleep
        else Found Job
            DB-->>Worker: Job (Status: Processing)
            Worker->>Processor: ProcessAsync(Job)

            Processor->>External: Get Neighborhoods (PDOK)
            External-->>Processor: List of Neighborhoods

            loop For Each Neighborhood
                Processor->>External: Get Stats (CBS)
                Processor->>DB: UPSERT Neighborhood
                Processor->>DB: Update Job Progress %
            end

            alt Success
                Processor-->>Worker: Done
                Worker->>DB: UPDATE "BatchJobs" (Status: Completed)
            else Failure
                Processor-->>Worker: Exception
                Worker->>DB: UPDATE "BatchJobs" (Status: Failed)
            end
        end
    end
```
