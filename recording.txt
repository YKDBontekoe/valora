1.  **Dependency Injection of Metadata**: Using a dedicated  to wrap  and API calls for support status allows for easy testing and consistent access to app metadata across the Flutter app.
2.  **Mocking Static Methods**:  is essential for testing services that rely on platform channels for version information.
3.  **Backend Config-Driven Features**: Exposing support status via a simple API endpoint backed by  allows changing support availability and messaging without redeploying the mobile app.
4.  **Graceful Fallbacks**: Implementing fallback logic in the frontend service ensures the app remains functional and informative even if the metadata/support API endpoint is unreachable.
